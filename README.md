2. How Skills from Each Module Apply to the Application

Organization and Time Management:     Use project management tools like jira to break down tasks like building the task input form and filtering functionality.
Values, Data Types, and Operations:    Store and manipulate task data like titles (strings), deadlines (dates), and completion status (booleans).
The Growth Mindset:    Continuously improve the app by gathering user feedback to add new features like reminders or categories.
Stringing Characters Together:    Use strings to display task titles, descriptions, and status messages (e.g., "Task 'Buy groceries' is complete").
Control Structures and Logic:    Use if/else statements to determine if a task is overdue based on its deadline.
Working with Loops:    Use loops to display all tasks or filter tasks based on their status (e.g., show only pending tasks).
Building Arrays:    Store lists of tasks in arrays for easy access and manipulation.
Using Arrays:    Use array methods like filter or map to find specific tasks or update their status.
